            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here hath already beene ſo much ſpoken by the other Gentlemen, concerning this accuſation of high treaſon, even ſufficient, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to cleare us all that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, that I know not what to ſay more touching the ſame: Onely under favour give me leave, to ſpeake what I conceive of the cauſe of the procuring of this accuſation, the Authors that procured it, and of the effects which <hi>I</hi> perceive will follow upon the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97742:3"/>
M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> It is not long ſince this Honourable Houſe accuſed of high Treaſon the twelve Biſhops, for their illegall and trayterous attempt in their petition and proteſtation againſt the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Theſe Gentlemen with my ſelfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, having the proſecution of that buſineſſe, and other charges of great Crimes againſt them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our truſt, did unanimouſly with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent follow the ſame, bringing to a period our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and diſputes concerning their crimes, what we conceived they were guilty of upon their ſeverall charges, &amp; what guilty of for framing &amp; preferring their petition and proteſtation to his Majeſty, that they were guilty of miſpriſion of treaſon upon their former accuſations, and guilty of high treaſon upon this their laſt deſigne: And theſe our votes and and concluſions (grounded and warranted, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Common lawes of this land, but by divers Acts of Parliament, and preſidents) we preſented to the whole houſe for conſideration and confirmation of the ſame by generall vote, with whom wee againe agreed by our publique votes, and thereupon they were impeached and committed; this I conceive provoked their malice againſt us, and was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſe of this their plot in drawing an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt us for the ſame crime of treaſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make us ſeeme as vile as themſelves, and to take away our votes at their triall. And thus I have joynd together both the cauſe and Authors of this accuſation.</p>
            <p>The effects I conceive will be dangerous, and cauſe great trouble in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:97742:3"/>
1 In turning the Current of the Parliaments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt them upon us, by which deviſe they ſhall have further time to put in practice their plots, and bring to perfection their purpoſes againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That being buſily imployed concerning this buſineſſe, in their diſputes about breach of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament in illegall accuſing the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, in drawing a declaration to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie concerning the ſame, in appeaſing him, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſincerity and integrity of the Parliament to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Majeſtie and other things pertinent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, this high Court may lay aſide their procce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and avert their purpoſes touching the Iriſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, whereby the Rebellion there may increaſe; and forraigne aide brought to them, to the utter loſing of that kingdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Many feares and troubles will ariſe in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens concerning this accuſation, of deſperate and devilliſh ſtratagems in agitation, as wel againſt them as the Parliament by diſconſolate &amp; diſaffected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to the ſafety and ſecurity thereof, cauſing their continuall watching and guarding by their trained bands, which will bee to them a great charge and moleſtation.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It will incourage ill affected and pernitious Cavaliers, and commanders about Court, to attempt any miſcheife againſt both houſes of Parliament or particular members thereof upon the Leaſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, that ſhall be offered them, thinking thereby they ſhall doe the King good ſervice, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they dare not adventure, to put in practiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb facs="tcp:97742:4"/>
5 And laſtly; It will provoke and ſtir up a diſlike of theſe deſignes in the hearts of all his Majeſties ſubjects, and diſaffection to his ſacred perſon, cauſe great uproares, and tumults of the Citizens; yea, and I feare a generall inſurrection in the kingdome, if not ſuddainly prevented, which God forbid.</p>
            <p>And thus Maſter Speaker, having nothing more to ſay concerning theſe Articles, I humbly crave of this Honourable houſe, that I may have expedition in my triall, upon the ſame; and that all things done by this wiſe Councell may tend to the Honour and glory of Almighty God, the peace and ſafety of his ſacred Majeſtie and all his kingdomes.</p>
